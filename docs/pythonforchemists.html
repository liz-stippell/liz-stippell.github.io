<center><h3>1. A Brief Introduction to Python</h3></center>

    <p>Python is an open-source programming language, with multiple ways to use it. Python is an <i>autocompiler</i> meaning all you need to do is run it, without any extra steps that other languages (such as C or C++) require. Any Python libraries (such as <i>math</i>, <i>numpy</i>, or <i>scipy</i>) are similarly free and open source, helping to make Python an excellent choice for a variety of fields and disciplines, including chemistry.</p>

    <p>Python can be utilized in many ways to help any chemist, regardless of topic area. It can solve equations ranging from a theoretical yield calculation to the Schroedinger Equation. It can also be used for data analysis and plotting, and can even take data saved in a CSV file (such as an Excel spreadsheet or Google sheet) and manipulate it. Instead of remembering countless formulas, you can create <i>functions</i> in Python which will be able to compute anything from unit conversions to molecular dynamics methods.</p>

    <p>Due to its open-source nature, one can run Python in a few ways. It is recommended if you are a beginner programmer to use <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> which is commonly installed through <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>. It is recommended that you download Anaconda and access Jupyter Notebook through there. For more advanced programmers, an <i>integrated development environment</i>, or <i>IDE</i> is recommended (<i>VScode</i> is a common choice).</p>

<center><h4>1.1 "Hello World"</h4></center>

    <p>"Hello World" refers to the first step that any programmer takes on their journey. This is the foundation of anything going forward. "Hello World" will produce what every programmer wants: an <i>output</i>. Most of the time, you have to tell your code that you want it to show, or <i>print</i> an answer based on the code you've given it. A computer that knows what 1+1 equals is useless if it does not show the answer. Luckily, it is simple to tell Python you want to see the output. Python, just like any human language, has vocabulary and grammar to it. Just as one can learn to fluently speak Spanish or German, so can you learn to "speak" fluent Python. First, let's look at what the code looks like if we want to have Python print "Hello World":</p>
    <center>
    <code>
      print("Hello World")
    </code>
    </center>
      
    <p>Now that we  see what the code looks like, let's break down each part. First, we have <code>print</code>. This is a function. <b>Any function looks of the form <code>[name](parameter)</code>, where in this case the name of the function is <code>print</code> and its <i>parameter</i> (this can also be thought of as a variable, which will become more obvious later on) is <code>"Hello World"</code> </b>. For this function, we are telling Python to print (again, this is the function) the parameter ("Hello World"). And, just as in any writing, quotes indicate what we want to say (in this case, print).</p>
