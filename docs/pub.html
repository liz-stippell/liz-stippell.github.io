      <h2>PySyComp: A Symbolic Python Library for the Undergraduate Quantum Chemistry Course</h2></a>
    <i>Published: September 2023, Journal of Chemical Education</i> <br>
    <b>Abstract</b><br>
    We report an educational tool for the upper level undergraduate quantum chemistry or quantum physics course that uses a symbolic approach via the PySyComp Python library. The tool covers both time-independent and time-dependent quantum chemistry, with the latter rarely considered in the foundations course due to topic complexity. We use quantized Hamiltonian dynamics (QHD) that provides a simple extension of classical dynamics and captures key quantum effects. The PySyComp library can compute various concepts regarding the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics, including normalized wave functions, expectation values, and commutators, which are at the core of solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. It provides a tool for students to experiment with simple models and explore the key quantum concepts, such as zero-point energy, tunneling, and decoherence.

      <h2>Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics with Extended Density Functional Tight-Binding: Application to Nanocrystals and Periodic Solids</h2></a>
    <i>Published: June 2022, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation</i> <br>
    <b>Abstract</b><br>
    In this work, we report a new methodology for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations within the extended tight-binding (xTB) framework. We demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach to finite and periodic systems with thousands of atoms by modeling “hot” electron relaxation dynamics in silicon nanocrystals and electron–hole recombination in both a graphitic carbon nitride monolayer and a titanium-based metal–organic framework (MOF). This work reports the nonadiabatic dynamic simulations in the largest Si nanocrystals studied so far by the xTB framework, with diameters up to 3.5 nm. For silicon nanocrystals, we find a non-monotonic dependence of “hot” electron relaxation rates on the nanocrystal size, in agreement with available experimental reports. We rationalize this relationship by a combination of decreasing nonadiabatic couplings related to system size and the increase of available coherent transfer pathways in systems with higher densities of states. We emphasize the importance of proper treatment of coherences for obtaining such non-monotonic dependences. We characterize the electron–hole recombination dynamics in the graphitic carbon nitride monolayer and the Ti-containing MOF. We demonstrate the importance of spin-adaptation and proper sampling of surface hopping trajectories in modeling such processes. We also assess several trajectory surface hopping schemes and highlight their distinct qualitative behavior in modeling the excited-state dynamics in superexchange-like models depending on how they handle coherences between nearly parallel states.
