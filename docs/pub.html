    <p>
      <i>Published: November 2024, Journal of the American Chemical Society</i> <br><br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Open-circuit voltage deficits are limiting factors in kesterite solar cells. Addressing this issue by suppressing band tailing and nonradiative charge recombination is essential for enhancing the performance. We employ ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics to elucidate the origin of band tailing and charge losses and propose a mitigation strategy. The simulations show that Cu–Zn disorder, associated with antisite defect clusters [CuZn+ZnCu], is a significant source of band tailing in kesterites, as evidenced by the much larger Urbach energy in disordered than ordered kesterites. Cu–Zn disorder gives rise to new sulfur-centered coordination polyhedra, increases structural inhomogeneity, changes electrostatic potential at sulfur centers, and shifts the S(3p) orbital energy. Differences in the S(3p)/Cu(3d) and S(3p)/Sn(5s) hybridization strengths and the S(3p) orbital energy shift reduce the band gap by 0.37 eV. Furthermore, Cu–Zn disorder enhances vibrational motion of sulfur anions and surrounding cations, increasing band gap fluctuations by 15 meV. The stronger electron–phonon interactions reduce charge carrier lifetimes and limit the kesterite solar cell efficiency. Partial substitution of Zn with Cd facilitates structural ordering and significantly suppresses band tailing, particularly in disordered systems. The improvement can be attributed to the larger atomic radius and mass of Cd, which weakens bonding around the anion, suppresses S-related vibrations within the covalent tetrahedra, and reduces nonadiabatic coupling, thereby increasing charge carrier lifetimes. The reported results establish the key influence of cation disorder on band tailing and reduced charge carrier lifetimes in kesterites and highlight cation disorder engineering as a strategy to achieve high-efficiency kesterite solar cells.

    <p>
      <i>Published: October 2024, Journal of the American Chemical Society</i> <br><br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Halide interstitial defects severely hinder the optoelectronic performance of metal halide perovskites, making research on their passivation crucial. We demonstrate, using ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, that hydrogen vacancies (Hv) at both N and C atoms of the methylammonium (MA) cation in MAPbI3 efficiently passivate iodine interstitials (Ii), providing a self-passivation strategy for dealing with the Hv and Ii defects simultaneously. Hv at the N site (Hv-N) introduces a defect state into the valence band, while the state contributed by Hv at the C site (Hv-C) evolves from a shallow level at 0 K to a deep midgap state at ambient temperature, exhibiting a high environmental activity. Both Hv-N and Hv-C are strong Lewis bases, capable of capturing and passivating Ii defects. Hv-C is a stronger Lewis base, bonds with Ii better, and exhibits a more pronounced passivation effect. The charge carrier lifetimes in the passivated systems are significantly longer than in those containing either Hv or Ii, and even in pristine MAPbI3. Our demonstration of the Hv and Ii defect self-passivation in MAPbI3 suggests that systematic control of the relative concentrations of Hv and Ii can simultaneously eliminate both types of defects, thereby minimizing charge and energy losses. The demonstrated defect self-passivation strategy provides a promising means for defect control in organic–inorganic halide perovskites and related materials and deepens our atomistic understanding of defect chemistry and charge carrier dynamics in solar energy and optoelectronic materials.

      Building a DFT+U machine learning interatomic potential for uranium dioxide</h2></a>
    <p>
    <i>Published: December 2023, Artificial Intelligence Chemistry</i> <br><br>
    <b>Abstract</b><br>
    Despite uranium dioxide (UO2) being a widely used nuclear fuel, fuel performance models rely extensively on empirical correlations of material behavior, leveraging the historical operating experience of UO2. Mechanistic models that consider an atomistic understanding of the processes governing fuel performance (such as fission gas release and creep) will enable a better description of fuel behavior under non-prototypical conditions such as in new reactor concepts or for modified UO2 fuel compositions. To this end, molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful tool for rapidly predicting physical properties of proposed fuel candidates. However, the reliability of these simulations depends largely on the accuracy of the atomic forces. Traditionally, these forces are computed using either a classical force field (FF) or density functional theory (DFT). While DFT is relatively accurate, the computational cost is burdensome, especially for f-electron elements, such as actinides. By contrast, classical FFs are computationally efficient but are less accurate. For these reasons, we report a new accurate machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for UO2 that provides high-fidelity reproduction of DFT forces at a similar low cost to classical FFs. We employ an active learning approach that autonomously augments the DFT training data set to iteratively refine the MLIP. To further improve the quality of our predictions, we utilize transfer learning to retrain our MLIP to higher-accuracy DFT+U data. We validate our MLIPs by comparing predicted physical properties (e.g., thermal expansion and elastic properties) with those from existing classical FFs and DFT/DFT+U calculations, as well as with experimental data when available.

      PySyComp: A Symbolic Python Library for the Undergraduate Quantum Chemistry Course</h2></a>
    <p>
    <i>Published: September 2023, Journal of Chemical Education</i> <br><br>
    <b>Abstract</b><br>
    We report an educational tool for the upper level undergraduate quantum chemistry or quantum physics course that uses a symbolic approach via the PySyComp Python library. The tool covers both time-independent and time-dependent quantum chemistry, with the latter rarely considered in the foundations course due to topic complexity. We use quantized Hamiltonian dynamics (QHD) that provides a simple extension of classical dynamics and captures key quantum effects. The PySyComp library can compute various concepts regarding the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics, including normalized wave functions, expectation values, and commutators, which are at the core of solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. It provides a tool for students to experiment with simple models and explore the key quantum concepts, such as zero-point energy, tunneling, and decoherence.

      Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics with Extended Density Functional Tight-Binding: Application to Nanocrystals and Periodic Solids</h2></a>
    <p>
    <i>Published: June 2022, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation</i> <br><br>
    <b>Abstract</b><br>
    In this work, we report a new methodology for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations within the extended tight-binding (xTB) framework. We demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach to finite and periodic systems with thousands of atoms by modeling “hot” electron relaxation dynamics in silicon nanocrystals and electron–hole recombination in both a graphitic carbon nitride monolayer and a titanium-based metal–organic framework (MOF). This work reports the nonadiabatic dynamic simulations in the largest Si nanocrystals studied so far by the xTB framework, with diameters up to 3.5 nm. For silicon nanocrystals, we find a non-monotonic dependence of “hot” electron relaxation rates on the nanocrystal size, in agreement with available experimental reports. We rationalize this relationship by a combination of decreasing nonadiabatic couplings related to system size and the increase of available coherent transfer pathways in systems with higher densities of states. We emphasize the importance of proper treatment of coherences for obtaining such non-monotonic dependences. We characterize the electron–hole recombination dynamics in the graphitic carbon nitride monolayer and the Ti-containing MOF. We demonstrate the importance of spin-adaptation and proper sampling of surface hopping trajectories in modeling such processes. We also assess several trajectory surface hopping schemes and highlight their distinct qualitative behavior in modeling the excited-state dynamics in superexchange-like models depending on how they handle coherences between nearly parallel states.
