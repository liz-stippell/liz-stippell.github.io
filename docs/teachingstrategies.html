    <h3>1. Note-Taking & Organizational Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The Zettelkasten method</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Zettelkasten describes a method of personal knowledge management where bite-sized pieces of information are written, categorized, and connected. This method is similar, to a certain degree, to Wikipedia and similar knowledge databases. Building your own knowledge database promotes a deeper understanding of not only the material itself but its connections to other areas and larger themes. My Zettelkasten consists of relevant research topics, theories, methods, and applications across computational chemistry. I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> which uses markdown files. For information on getting started with Zettelkasten in Obsidian, check out <a href="https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-zettelkasten-in-obsidian/" target="_blank">this webpage</a>. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Journal article management</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>1. <b>Zotero</b> is a great, <b>free</b> program for citation and article management. Zotero can be downloaded <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and has browser plugins to make citing articles easy.</i>
      <br>
      <i>2. <b>Endnote</b> is a paid program for citation and article management. Endnote can be downloaded <a href="https://endnote.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVXeEPliONzkVGr8oBXlc2bIt9RdNNxmNSn8XoysI4fBka2VaA" target="_blank">here</a>. Some universities and organizations offer free or discounted versions of endnote.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Time blocking strategies</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Google Calendar is great for blocking out your day, week, or even month. Time can be blocked to varying degrees of specificity, from general time for reading articles to blocking out times for specific research goals.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Using a daily productivity notebook: the importance of self-discipline</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Using a daily productivity notebook has been extremely beneficial for myself. The format I use allows me to write down what I have accomplished throughout a day along with two priority lists: a main priority list for the following day or two, and a secondary priority list for longer-term goals that do not need to be completed immediately. By having these three sections, I am able to see what I have done and what I want to accomplish in just a few lines.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Spreadsheets for project management</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>I have learned that creating extensive spreadsheets for multi-project management has helped me keep my goals in focus. Before starting a project, I create a new section in my spreadsheet that provides a rough outline/checklist of all of the different pieces needed for a specific project and its corresponding goals. As the project starts and continues, I can add or subtract from my project checklist, making sure to touch on "flagstone" parts of a project (e.g., "run geometry optimization", or "calculate atomic displacements"). The spreadsheet is effective for larger goals, and the daily priority notebook, as described previously, is good for the day-to-day finer details.</i>
